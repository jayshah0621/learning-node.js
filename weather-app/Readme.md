A simple weather app that takes the address as the argument and returns the current temperature and the apparent temperature (feels like).

To run the app (via app.js) use the following command:

node app.js -a="san francisco"

To run the app (via app-axios.js) use the following command:

node app-axios.js -a="san francisco"

app-axios.js uses the axios module, which supports Promises for HTTP requests.
